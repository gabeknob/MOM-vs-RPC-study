# MOM-vs-RPC-study
This repo is a project assignment for my Distributed Programming class. In here we implement and compare the performance of the same distributed system written in Go using RPC and MOM. The system is a group of backend application instances that receives and process SQL queries gated by an intelligent load balancer.
